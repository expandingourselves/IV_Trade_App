# IV_Trade_App
Enter a stock ticker and the app analyzes options and price data to build the ATM IV term structure, estimate the near-term expected move, and gauge liquidity. It then scores the setup (Recommended / Consider / Avoid), shows pass/fail on key checks, and plots ATM IV vs DTE with a link to the earnings calendar.
